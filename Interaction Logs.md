# Breakup-Sage — ChatGPT Conversation Links

This file collected the ChatGPT/Claude sessions related to the **Breakup-Sage** project. I listed each relevant session (date, title, short description) and left a placeholder for the ChatGPT share link. You can paste the corresponding shareable chat URL into the “Chat link” column and I will update this file for you.

## Faced a lot of problem while tokenizing dataset :

## Juggled a lot with checkpoints file to run it with the base model :

## Adding new features and optimizng the workflow :

Can't find the log of streamlit deployment code. I guess that was trivial too, the real hassle were the above ones whne i was reading them and debugging them when GPT "betrayed" me.
